# 📈 Stock Trend Prediction using LSTM
Predicting future stock trends using deep learning (LSTM) on historical stock data
Built with TensorFlow/Keras | Python | Time Series Forecasting.

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to model and predict stock price trends over time.

Stock markets are inherently sequential in nature, and LSTM networks are capable of capturing long-term dependencies in such time-series data. This project builds a predictive model trained on historical stock prices and evaluates its ability to anticipate future trends.

🔧 Tech Stack & Libraries
	•	 Python
	•	 Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
	•	 Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
	•	 TensorFlow / Keras – Deep Learning framework
	•	  LSTM – Sequence modeling

 🧠 What the Model Does
	•	Reads historical stock data (Open, Close, Volume, etc.)
	•	Preprocesses and scales the data
	•	Structures it into sequences for LSTM input
	•	Builds and trains an LSTM model
	•	Evaluates performance through trend comparison
	•	Visualizes predicted vs actual stock prices
